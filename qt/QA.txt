两个参数，前者是要判断的active的选项，后者是互斥的选项的一个集合。
Finally, CONFIG(debug, debug|release) evaluates to true if CONFIG contains "debug" but not "release", 
or if it contains both "debug" and "release" but "release" doesn't appear after the last occurrence of "debug". 
For example you might have this:

CONFIG += release debug release debug release debug
Since the last "debug" comes after the last "release", CONFIG(debug, debug|release) is true.

The first argument of CONFIG() ("debug" in this case) is the value that has to appear last. 
The second argument ("debug|release") is the set of values that the first argument is checked against.

Translating that to English would give something like this: evaluate to true if "debug" appears at least once and, 
in case "release" appears too, the last appearance of "debug" comes after the last appearance of "release".
